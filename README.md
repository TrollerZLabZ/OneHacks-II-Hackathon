# Kimera App
## OneHacks-II-Hackathon
Our Project for the OneHacks II Hackathon

## The Vintage Camera Emulator that will send you back to the 2000s

## Inspiration
For everyone in my team, it's our first hackathon, so we wanted to make something not very complicated, but very useful. What better than a camera app? 
## What it does
Our "Kimera App" is a classic camera app that allows you take photos with other functionalities, such as mirroring the image, a hex color slider, and grayscale.
## How we built it
We used the OpenCV Python library for capturing the video from the webcam, we used TkInter for the GUI(buttons and functionalities) and Pillow for better processing capabilities and styling.
## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into included unnecessary borders around buttons. Another bug was when the picture we took from the app displayed our faces and skin as blue.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create a tint selector and applier with a hex color slider, which was a great addition to the app. Using CV2 and Tkinter together was also a great idea, as we were able to capture video frames, and at the same time add buttons and functionalities.
## What we learned
We learned that hackathons are a great experience, and a great way to share your skill, develop your passion for coding, and grow your skill. This was our entire team's first hackathon, and I'm sure that we will attend many more, if it's in the same team or alone.
## What's next for Kimera App
We look forward to improving the GUI of the application, diversifying the amount of filters, and even adding a gallery for the app. We will also be compiling the code to make use easier. A more "official" release is also one of our goals.
